            NOTES ABOUT THE EXECS IN THIS FILE


0.  These execs were tested on a z/OS 2.1 system, and some of
    them were found wanting, while others worked.

    Some of the REXX execs in this file didn't have the word
    "REXX" in a comment on the first line.  So this had to be
    corrected.

1.  ASCB and ASCB2 need to be fixed.

2.  The APFLIST exec is programmed to look for an "old format"
    APF list, from before the list became dynamic.  I have copied
    LISTAPFT and LISTAPF2 REXX execs from CBT File 275 to give
    you 2 tools that work for z/OS 2.1.

3.  UCB lookups have been changed.  If you use the UCBSCAN macro
    in an assembler program, it is possible (probable) that the
    tool will still work.  But the REXX execs that try and go
    directly to control blocks, to list UCBs, will probably fail.
    I have copied the LISTDCQ member here to show you one way to
    look up UCB stuff nowadays.  This does the ULUT headers only,
    and will not be completely adequate for going through all the
    UCB's, so I included the LISTDASD and LISTTAPE execs from File
    220 to show you how to do that.

4.  EDT**** don't work because the EDT is type 2 or higher.  There
    is a different way of accessing the EDT now.
    For a substitute to obtain this information, install MXI from
    Files 409 and 410, and use the EDT display from there, which
    is very nice.

5.  The DSCB EXEC works nicely.

6.  DIRPDS works fine.  DASDUCB (when the subroutine has been
    assembled) works, but needs to be customized for your shop.

7.  LDSITEST appears to work fine.

8.  The DSCB command works very well.

9.  CAXWA command works, except for lining up the output.  Useful
    anyway.

10. For RDSNTEST, you have to have a compatible WHOHAS command
    installed.  I haven't found one, so therefore I haven't gotten
    RDSNTEST to work.  Doesn't mean that you can't fix it.

11. RETSTORE does UCB lookups, and will have to be reworked.

12. SYSBASE works pretty well, except for a few fields.

13. The SUBSYS exec seems to work fine.

14. SSCTLOOK appears to work fine.


  So far so good.  Please let me know about your experiences
  with the things in this file, so that the next guy won't have
  to fix as much.
